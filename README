== Description

ChainGang is a drop-dead simple worker process framework.

== Example Usage

  require "rubygems"
  require "chaingang"

  class Worker
    def setup
      # Set up connections here
    end

    def teardown
      # Tear down connections here
    end

    def call
      # Do some work
      sleep 1
    end
  end
  ChainGang.prepare(Worker.new)

Any object that responds to the :call message may be used by ChainGang as a
worker.  The optional :setup and :teardown messages may also be implemented
if necessary.  Workers are primarily controlled via rake tasks, but may also
be run manually.  Because the :call message is the only message required,
a block may also be used as a worker:

  require "rubygems"
  require "chaingang"

  ChainGang.prepare do
    # Do some work
    sleep 1
  end

== Requirements

* ChainGang has no dependencies.

== Install

* sudo gem install chaingang
